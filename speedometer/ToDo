CODE/HW: test and install LDR 
CODE   : ADD LDR menu to mega. Option to enable or disable auto lights.
Upload code to uno to correct odo reset.
Have timer start and stop when he speed is greater than 0
reset timer when odo is reset

enum LightState { //create a OdoEnums.h for this.
  LIGHT_AUTO = 1, //lights on automatic (for on/off)
  LIGHT_ON, // Lights always on
  LIGH_OFF //  lights always off.
