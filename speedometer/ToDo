screen: 44mm(l)
by 37mm by 10mm(h)
CODE: coding need to be done
HW : hardware need to be done
CODE: add enum to lib

--------------TODO---------------

TAKE SNAPSHOT OF WIRING ON PAPER>> THIS WORKS!!!

HW     : Make Junction box 
HW     : Make Rear LED light
HW     : Make box for screen - 3D print with TINKERCAD 
HW     : Solder PCB balance/protection to battery.  		DONE
		 add step up to charge the battery (verify)
		 Verify that the battery protection discharge/charge both battery properly.
CODE   : add battery reading
CODE   : Do not save ODO when only half rotation of the wheel./ Maybe use vibration trigger to know when to restart
CODE   : Save light power status in EEPROM to return to saved value when turning back on. (SLAVE)

---------------TEST--------------


------------TEST DONE--------------
CODE   : SLAVE, LDR - add a delay when swithing from dark to light and light to dark. 
CODE/HW: add mosfet control to light and TEST light with LED driver. TEST LIGHT with Battery and LED driver
CODE/HW: Find github code for temperature sensor. https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MCP9808_Library
CODE   : when getting revolution count from master convert the right amount from the char array. ex if rev = 1, then only 1 char , if rev = 3435 then 4 char to atoi. Slavev2
CODE   : when starting , id ODO has information, load it right away at startup (Display on screen at startup)  - Slavev2
CODE   : Load timer if any at startup on screen - Master
CODE   : pass current odo information to arduino if not reset on startup. Right now currentOdo start at 0 every reboot.
CODE   : Shift text to left when batt is 100%. text is getting cutoff for battery
CODE   : save timer into eeprom when turning off. when reset, reset timer in eeprom also
CODE: test new elapsed time in interrupt (10 millis).
CODE: test save speed in 1 min.
CODE   : Add code to master for printing light percent.  
CODE: add code for light button when increasing or decreasing % in handleBTN for MASTER
CODE/HW: test and install LDR 
CODE   : ADD LDR menu to mega. Option to enable or disable auto lights.
Upload code to uno to correct odo reset.
Have timer start and stop when he speed is greater than 0
reset timer when odo is reset

enum LightState { //create a OdoEnums.h for this.
  LIGHT_AUTO = 1, //lights on automatic (for on/off)
  LIGHT_ON, // Lights always on
  LIGH_OFF //  lights always off.
};
