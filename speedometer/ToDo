CODE: coding need to be done
HW : hardware need to be done
CODE: add enum to lib

--------------TODO---------------
HW     : Make Junction box - 3D print with TINKERCAD
HW     : Make Rear LED light
HW     : Make box for screen
CODE/HW: add battery reading
HW     : Solder PCB protection to battery.    
CODE/HW: add mosfet control to light and TEST light with LED driver.
CODE   : Do not save ODO when only half rotation of the wheel./ Maybe use vribration trigger to know when to restart
CODE   : when getting revolution count from master convert the reight amount from the char array. ex if rev = 1, then only 1 char , if rev = 3435 then 4 char to atoi.
CDOE   : when starting , id ODO has information, load it right away at startup
CODE   : Find github code for temperature sensor.
CODE   : Load timer if any at startup on screen

---------------TEST--------------



------------TEST DONE--------------

CODE   : pass current odo information to arduino if not reset on startup. Right now currentOdo start at 0 every reboot.
CODE   : Shift text to left when batt is 100%. text is getting cutoff for battery
CODE   : save timer into eeprom when turning off. when reset, reset timer in eeprom also
CODE: test new elapsed time in interrupt (10 millis).
CODE: test save speed in 1 min.
CODE   : Add code to master for printing light percent.  
CODE: add code for light button when increasing or decreasing % in handleBTN for MASTER
CODE/HW: test and install LDR 
CODE   : ADD LDR menu to mega. Option to enable or disable auto lights.
Upload code to uno to correct odo reset.
Have timer start and stop when he speed is greater than 0
reset timer when odo is reset

enum LightState { //create a OdoEnums.h for this.
  LIGHT_AUTO = 1, //lights on automatic (for on/off)
  LIGHT_ON, // Lights always on
  LIGH_OFF //  lights always off.
